## About the app

The application initially displays the posts and allows the user to access to the comments related to the selected post.

![posts-light](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67164680/129419773-a92da4e7-3531-4a11-b1da-21286f9ecaf5.png)

Additionally, redux was used to manage states, some components were tested and it is possible to make comments for each post by saving the information using redux.
As an extra, the dark-light theme option and the use of localstorage for data persistence also were added.

Initially, the application verifies the information in localstorage before fetch posts in order to preserve the status of the theme and comments that were added before. It is taken into account that another service will be updating the database for which subsequent queries will have to be made and thus keep the application updated.
In each fetch the loading ... text is displayed.

Just click on the post to go to the comments section:

Which also has its dark version:

At the bottom of the comments it is possible to enter a new one. In addition, the button to return to the posts section appears in right corner, this action is achieved using the Route component from the react-router-dom library.
For styling, modules are used that allow to split up the logical (js files) from styles (css files), automatically adding a unique identifier for each element.
For the stylized theme, the tailwindcss library was used as it makes it easy to implement throughout the application.
The following cases are taken into consideration:
When trying to make an http request to a wrong url, for example Post api specified wrong, the following message is displayed:

![cant-fetch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67164680/129420954-acf0998f-3150-47af-8f3f-29505042235b.png)

When trying to access an undefined route, a Not found message is delivered.

![bad-route](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67164680/129421238-7f5183a9-8a28-4f4a-958d-32630da14243.png)

When trying to access an undefined post (in this case greater than 100), a No posts found message is delivered.

![not-found](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67164680/129421181-98bb7980-f0df-434d-8b96-7bd9fbe6d679.png)

The last cases are shown with their own respective dark-light theme.
In case the comments or post request fails, not found will be displayed.
A possible improvement is to discriminate which one was failure so that it is still possible to show at least the successful request.
Another possible improvement would be that if the request fails, it shows the data from localStorage.
The application is made up of three main folders: Components, hooks and store. The components folder also includes the UI folder, where there are standard reusable components.

![folders](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67164680/129421417-0624cf3d-85ae-4010-a7b1-32adb92730ce.png)

Two custom hooks were created, one to make http requests (custom requests) and the other to modify the theme, enabling refactoring and delegating specific tasks outside the components.
The last store folder contains the store management system (redux) which was used to centralize states, update and make them available through the components.
The App.js file makes the call to obtain the information and renders the components.
A possible improvement is to clean the App.js file, so that it only renders a single component (creating a Layout component for example) making it clear that this is its only function following the practice of making a component as specific and simple as possible.
